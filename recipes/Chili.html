        <h2>Description</h2>    
        <p>
                Chili is a stew. Stews are thicker than soup and generally require a long cooking time. Traditionally they rely on tough cuts of meat with lots of connective tissue; over the long cooking time the connective tissue breaks down into gelatin, which thickens the stew and leaves a tender piece of meat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chili specifically is stew seasoned with (normally dried) chili peppers (hence the name). Normally this means chili powder, but the traditional way to make it is to toast, rehydrate, and puree dried chili peppers in broth.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add tomato paste, stirring to coat vegetables. Add ground beef and cook, breaking up meat with a spoon, until no longer pink, about 7 minutes. Drain any excess fat.</li>
